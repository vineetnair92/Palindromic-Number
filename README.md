# Largest Palindromic-Number
 Find the largest palindromic number in between two numbers that are input by the user

## Instructions to Run:

1) Download the .jar file [LargestPalindromicNumber] present in the folder LargestPalindromicNumber 
2) Double click the jar file for the application to run. A window would pop up.

3) Enter the lower and higher range values in the respective fields. 
4) Click on search button in order to compute the largest palindromic number.
5) The result field will display the largest palindromic number if it exists.


## Note:
1) Values at lower and higher range are included in computation of largest palindromic number.
[eg. 11 to 44 will have result as 44. Similarly 11 to 17 range will display 11] 

2) If higher and lower range values are negative then the search will not work as there is no palindromic number between them. [Reverse of -121 is 121- which is not a palindrome]

3) If the user interchanges the lower and upper range values, the application will automatically reverse the values. That is, the user could see the values swapped automatically.
 
4) If the user sees any/both of the two fields in red, it indicates that values entered is not right.
Possible reasons are:- String being entered as an input or both inputs being negative integers

5) The result field cannot be edited by the user.
